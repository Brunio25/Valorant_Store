# Valorant Store App
Android APP built using Kotlin with Jetpack Compose.

This was used to better grasp the Android ecosystem, and as fun little project to improve my Kotlin coding Skills. As an added bonus, I also learned quite a great deal about code Architechtures!

The project remains unfinished, as I'm not great with frontend (even if it is using Kotlin and not CSS Directly ðŸ˜„) and just don't want to spend time learning that right now, as I feel my time can be better spent on other topics!

Finally, I would just like to give a special thanks to my girlfriend for giving me the idea of what to build in the first place, I'm glad your Valorant "addiction" was useful at last!
